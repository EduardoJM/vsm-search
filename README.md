# Vector Space Model Search

## 1 - Introduction

This is a small (in development) version of a search ranking algorithm based on the [vector space model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model).

## 2 - Running

To run this example, for now, run from the `vsm-search` repository home, the following commands:

```sh
node ./src/makeIndexes.js
node ./src/search.js
```

## 3 - Observations

- To change the search term edit the `src/search.js`, for now.

- To change the posts, edit the `posts/data.json`, for now.
